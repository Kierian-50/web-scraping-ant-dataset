## In which context did I this project?

I did this project to download a dataset of images for CNN.

## The goal of the project

I saw that in a special web site there is a dataset which is very interesting for me but I wasn't able to find the download button so I made a small script to download each images from the web site.

## The progress of the project

The project is finish for me because using selenium was not a good idea in this case because it was too long and it depended on my bad connection. So I closed this project using selenium and I did another branch where I use Beautiful soup and a text file.

## Installation

This project isn't reusable because I made this project for a precise web site in a special context. But you can take the spirit of the code on the web scraping with selenium.
